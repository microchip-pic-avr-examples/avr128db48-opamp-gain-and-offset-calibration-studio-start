# Gain and Offset Calibration of the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) Peripheral

A new feature introduced in the AVRÂ® DB MCU is the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral. The OPAMP peripheral can be configured as a PGA and in this example, the internal DAC and ADC are used to calibrate the gain and offset for the PGA. For more information on the calibration procedure, see the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003633).
